									* His ult gives him damage reduction for the duration of the ability
									and is active most the game, due to how much mana he gains.<br>
									* With the Brawler trait as well, his health scales with Warmogs, which is

									<p><b><u>Civilian | Mascot</b></u><br>
									<br>* Galio is considered an <b>B tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Galio was previously considered S tier, but with nerfs to civilian and mascot, he has become less playable<br>
									* Galio is commonly used in a Supers, Civilian, and Mascot comp.<br>
									* The scaling damage from 3 stars in Supers, paired with the Civilian mana generation, and Mascot healing optimizes Galio and his comp<br>
									* Although The combinatino of all three of those traits is great. This comp can be wildly contested and can be hard to play with no prior knowledge</p>

									<p><b><u>Supers | Duelist</b></u><br>
									<br>* Gangplank is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Although Supers has been nerfed and Gangplank has been nerfed, he still holds up towards the top of the tiers.<br>
									* The reason why Gangplank is currently A and not a lower rank with the many nerfs is because of Duelist.<br>
									* Duelist has become a force to rekkon with in recent patches. It's scaling attack speed paired with many of the utility duelists can shred through numerous tanks<br>
									* Gangplank especially pairs very well with the scaling damage of Supers along with his ability that sheds all negative effects on him.</p>

									<p><b><u>Duelist | Duelist</b></u><br>
									<br>* Kayle is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Kayle is actually a very hit or miss champion in terms of tiers. With the correct augments, items, and composition, she flourishes as an A tier.<br>
									* Without augments, BIS items, and a decent composition, she is considered D tier quite easily.<br>
									* Underground is currently a wildly loved trait. If played correctly you can acquire a Tactition's crown, Radiant items, and tons of gold.<br>
									* Her having the Underground trait is incredibly valuable. Her along with two other Underground units are very easy to find, so it can be an easy trait to splash in.</p>

									<p><b><u>Gadgeteens | Heart</b></u><br>
									<br>* Lulu is considered an <b>B tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Lulu is considered B tier, because she cannot put out enough damage frequently and accurately.<br>
									* You would think that her ability being able to go through multiple units would do lots of damage paired with the scalig AP of the Heart trait, would do damage.<br>
									  Unfortunately It does not. Compared to other 1 costs that output lots of damage. She requires too many specific traits, specific augments, and specific items<br>
									  that she is just simply not playable as a carry. She is only there to be a trait bot until better units come along.<br>
									* The Gadgeteen trait also barely does anything useful for Lulu. The items you gain off of Gadgeteen typically goes on a better AP carry or tank.</p>

									<p><b><u>Star-Guardian | Spellslinger</b></u><br>
									<br>* Lux is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Lux is currently considered the best 1 cost AP carry in the game. Her ult damage is incredibly high for that of a 1 cost unit.<br>
									* She can use just about any AP item, making her incredibly versatile. She also does not require any specific augment to do well.<br>
									* What sets her behind being a S tier, is her ability accuracy. Although it is an AOE ability, her accuracy is surprisingly low.<br>
									* If a unit dies where she is going to cast, she casts where the dead enemy unit is, instead of hitting a new target, making her inconsistent.</p>

									<p><b><u>Anima-Squad | Mascot</b></u><br>
									<br>* Nasus is considered an <b>B tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Our poor Susan has struggled to fit in with the meta for quite some time now, keeping him at a consistent B tier.<br>
									* Before the Mascot nerfs pairs with his "BONK" augment, he would be considered High A tier.<br>
									* His damage output at the time paired with the healing from Mascot made him a force to be reckoned with, but only if you got that augment.<br>
									* He is entirely unplayable as a carry without the "BONK" augment, so he is simply kept out of a lot of comps, because he provides no utility or damage.</p>

									<p><b><u>Gadgeteens | Defender</b></u><br>
									<br>* Poppy is considered an <b>B tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Poppy has struggled to find her way into the front line tanks of 1 costs. She struggles to be a tank without so many specific items.<br>
									* Many AD carries can counter her Defender trait quite easily. Although Defender provides lots of armor, armor shredding items are prioritized in this meta.<br>
									* Even with her augment that gives 150 armor, she becomes incredibly weak to AP carries.<br>
									* The only thing preventing her from going into a lower tier, is Gadgeteen. Gadgeteen provides lots of useful tank items to help Poppy sustain.</p>

									<p><b><u>Lasercorps | Brawler</b></u><br>
									<br>* Reketon is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Reketon is a staple Tank in the Lastercore comp. Sejuani(4 cost Lasercorps Brawler) pairs incredibly well with Renekton.<br>
									* His ultimate gives his additional Max HP for the duration the round, making able to scale infinitely for the duration.<br> 
									* When units attack him the Lasercorps drones deal damage to the unit that is attacking him, which makes him very versatile.</p>

									<p><b><u>Anima-Squad | Renegade</b></u><br>
									<br>* Sylas is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Sylas doesn't necessarily do a lot of damage, but as a unit he provides two very useful traits for the early and late game.<br>
									* Early Anima-Squad allows your Anima-Squad units to get the early permanent health for every unit killed, so having an early Sylas lets you scale quick.<br>
									* His second trait Renegade is very powerful in the current meta. The last Renegade alive does Bonus damage, so having 6 Renegade is very strong late.</p>

									<br>* Talon is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Talon is such a great unit in this set. In set 8 there are no assassins.<br>
									* Talon's ability allows him to jump to a enemy unit in the corner and do lots of single target damage. This ability forces your opponent to position differently.<br>
									* With Renegade and his carry augment, he's able to cast frequently and do significantly more damage.</p>

									<p><b><u>Mecha-Prime | Defender</b></u><br>
									<br>* Wukong is considered an <b>A tier</b> unit as of this patch.<br>
									* Mecha-Prime is really what is carrying Wukong to A tier. As a carry with Mecha-Prime he does incredibly well.<br>
									* Mecha-Prime also makes him an incredible tank. It gives him a minimum of 1000 health to possibly 5000 health.<br>
									* There are also two Defenders in the Mecha-Prime trait, making Wukong a very versatile unit early, mid, and late game.<br></p>
